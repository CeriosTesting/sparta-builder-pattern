# Exercise 10: Create Your Own Domain - Master Challenge

**Final Project!** Apply everything you've learned to build a complete Builder Pattern system for your own domain.

## Your Mission

Choose any domain that interests you (gaming, e-commerce, healthcare, music, etc.) and create a complete Builder ecosystem.

## Requirements

### Part 1: Design Your Data Model
1. **Create complex JSON** with at least 3 levels of nesting
2. **Include arrays** of nested objects
3. **Use multiple data types** (string, number, boolean, Date, enums)
4. **Model your types** starting from the deepest level working up

### Part 2: Build Your Builders
1. **Create builders** for all complex types
2. **Implement** `create()` and `createWithDefaults()` methods
3. **Add custom methods** that solve real testing scenarios
4. **Write comprehensive tests** for each builder

### Part 3: Create Your Director
1. **Build a Director class** that orchestrates mass data creation
2. **Create different scenarios**
3. **Export test data** to JSON files for analysis

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Complete type system with proper organization
- [ ] Working builders with realistic fake data
- [ ] Custom methods that add real value
- [ ] Director that generates bulk test data
- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] Clean, well-structured code

**Prove you've mastered the Builder Pattern!** Use the patterns from previous exercises as your guide.
