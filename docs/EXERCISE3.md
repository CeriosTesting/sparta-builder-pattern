# Exercise 3: The first builder, the Address builder, let's run!

Open the test [address-builder.test.ts](../tests/address-builder.test.ts) and run all the tests one by one.

### create Address without builder

### create Address with builder

### create Address with builder and defaults
Run this test multiple times. What do you see?

### create Address with builder and defaults but force the house number
Also run this test multiple times. What is different from the previous one?
